\begin{abstract}
In this thesis we discuss details of implementing a probabilistic numerical solver for partial differential equations whose spatial domain is not a vector space. We cover topics including the concept of the metric tensor, embeddings of manifolds, mesh representations and refinement, discrete differential operators, ODEs, PDEs, and SDEs, numerical linear algebra, state space models, the (extended) Kálmán-filter and -smoother, and numerical stability. We conclude with experiments that test the efficiency of physically informed prior solutions in non-euclidean domains.

We have structured the thesis as a guide on how to implement and follow the results, and we try to motivate the steps to the best of our efforts.

With a long introduction to the topics of this thesis out the way, we can move to some contributions. The first contribution is an algorithm to build an intrinsic triangulation of manifolds provided only a metric tensor. This lets one apply the methods of discrete exterior calculus to obtain a discrete Laplacian, which can subsequently be used in the Method of Lines to solve PDEs, either using standard solvers or probabilistic solvers. The algorithm is detailed in the next section
